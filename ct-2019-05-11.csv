"This has no actual proof but it's fun to think about.

If you remember there was a Vine 2 coming out at some point or at least people were talking about it being made. So what if the creator(s) of vine realized that vine 2 will never be as successful as the first one so decided to scrap it. People would still talk about it of course (it's iconic duh) but they wanted people to forget about even the idea of vine 2 because they scraped vine 2. What's the best way of doing this? Releasing a similar app (memeability wise) so then there was TikTok.

TikTok was first popularised in Asia which would have the biggest ""test audience"". So vine could have easily created this app to leave vine untouched and iconic and left the money flowing in.

Or vine saw the potential in this app and realized that this could be it. They couldn't be suspicious though so they had to make it look as if another company bought tik tok so they first bought musically and kept it under wraps. They then proceeded to buy tiktok.

Don't you wonder why vine 2 is not talked about anymore?

"*The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved one of the most sought after vaccines in recent decades. It’s the world’s first vaccine to prevent dengue fever — a disease so painful that its nickname is  “breakbone fever.”*

*The vaccine, called Dengvaxia, is aimed at helping children in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories where dengue is a problem.*

**But this vaccine has a dark — and deadly — history. One that has led  to criminal charges in the Philippines, and sparked national panic.**

**Estimates are that more than 100,000 Philippine children received a vaccine that health officials say increased their risk of a severe and sometimes deadly condition. In addition, other children who received the  vaccine may have been endangered because, their parents alleged, they  were not in good health.**

The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur spent 20 years — and  about $2 billion — to develop Dengvaxia. The company tested it in several large trials with more than 30,000 kids globally and [published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506223) the results in the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*.

But halfway around the world from the Philippines, in a Washington,  D.C., suburb, one scientist was worried about the new vaccine.

&gt;“When I read the *New England* *Journal* article, I almost fell out of my chair,” says [Dr. Scott Halstead](https://www.emedevents.com/speaker-profile/scott-b-halstead-800221), who has studied dengue for more than 50 years with the U.S. military.

When Halstead looked at the vaccine’s safety data in the clinical trial, he knew right away there was a problem.

For some children, the vaccine didn’t seem to work. In fact, Halstead  says, it appeared to be harmful. When those kids caught dengue after being vaccinated, the vaccine appeared to worsen the disease in some instances. Specifically, for children who had never been exposed to dengue, the vaccine seemed to increase the risk of a deadly complication called plasma leakage syndrome, in which blood vessels start to [leak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334930/) the yellow fluid of the blood.

&gt;**“Then everything gets worse, and maybe it’s impossible to save your life,” Halstead says. “A child can go into shock.”**  
 **“The trouble is that the disease occurs very rapidly, just in a  matter of a few hours,” he adds. “And there’s nothing on the outside of  the body to signify the person is leaking fluid on the inside.”**

He was so worried about the safety concerns that he wrote at least six editorials for scientific journals. He even made a video to warn the Philippine government about the problem.

&gt;**“I just think, ‘No, you can’t give a vaccine to a perfectly normal, healthy person and then put them at an increased risk for the rest of their lives for plasma leakage syndrome,’ ” Halstead  says. “You can’t do that.”**

The vaccine manufacturer disagreed with Halstead’s interpretation of the study’s results. The company [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452651) a rebuttal, asserting that regulatory agencies had approved Dengvaxia  “on the basis of the vaccine’s proven protection and acceptable safety  profile.”

# Despite these concerns, in July 2016, the World Health Organization went ahead and recommended the vaccine for all children ages 9 to 16.

In November 2017, Sanofi [published](https://mediaroom.sanofi.com/en/press-releases/2017/sanofi-updates-information-on-dengue-vaccine/) an announcement on its website saying it had new information about Dengvaxia’s safety.

Halstead’s fears were confirmed. Sanofi had found evidence that the vaccine increases the risk of hospitalization and cytoplasmic leakage syndrome in children who had no prior exposure to dengue, regardless of age.

&gt;**“For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination should not be recommended,” the company  wrote.**

Panic hit the Philippines. In news reports, parents said that the vaccine contributed to the deaths of 10 children.

Protests erupted. The Congress of the Philippines launched investigations into the vaccine’s purchase and the immunization campaign. And Philippine health officials started performing autopsies on children who died after receiving the vaccine.

&gt;**“In total, the deaths of about 600 children who received  Dengvaxia are under investigation by the Public Attorney’s Office, ”** the  *South China Morning Post* [reported ](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3006712/philippines-suspicion-dengue-vaccine-linked)last month.

WHO eventually changed its recommendation. The agency now says the vaccine is safe only for children who have had a prior dengue infection.

By the time Sanofi acknowledged this problem with the vaccine, about  800,000 Philippine children had been vaccinated. The Sanofi study estimated that more than 100,000 of them had never been infected with dengue and should not have received the shot, according to [WHO’s revised recommendation](https://www.who.int/medicines/news/2017/WHO-advises-dengvaxia-used-only-in-people-previously-infected/en/).

Here in the U.S., the approval of the vaccine — to be used in Puerto  Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Guam — comes with an  important restriction: Doctors must have proof of a prior dengue infection to ensure the vaccine will not pose any risks to the child.

That’s a safeguard Philippine families never had.

We have all heard about some theories about aliens and things of that sort being hidden from the public eyes

While watching some video on YouTube about hackers and interesting web activities i came up with a possible Explaination for a phenomenon that is : 
hackers finding documents about aliens and similar things (allegedly).. and publishing it online

My simple theory is :

The goverments came up with an idea  to combat hacking and data theft :

(After having regular security and firewalls and all these stuff)

They needed a way to see if it works or not, right?

So here's what they might have done to find out if there has been a leak or not:

*Create a classified document on a high clearance computer/server 

*Write some titles like : ""operation alfa35"" /"" aliens 24/05/2003 update""

(They could make specific file names for specific bases and servers so they would track down the leak)

And finally

They go online to search for said files/Names

Including deep/dark web searches

If they find something .. that would mean that the security is a joke

If not.. hypothetically it is all ok

Something about she wasn’t charged for some shady things.. idk. Anyhow, there are supposed to be a bunch of biker gangs, conspiracy theorist, extreme Christians, and immense alt-right support. 

Mostly curious if anyone has heard of this or is planning on attending. Apparently infowars and  Fox News are supposed to be there and he’s in touch with Kellyanne Conways lawyer seeking protection for the event. 

It’s a long shot but any info helps. He’s an interesting cat with some far fetched ideas, gauging weight here :) TIA",ct

If you remember there was a Vine 2 coming out at some point or at least people were talking about it being made. So what if the creator(s) of vine realized that vine 2 will never be as successful as the first one so decided to scrap it.

Releasing a similar app (memeability wise) so then there was TikTok.

TikTok was first popularised in Asia which would have the biggest ""test audience"". So vine could have easily created this app to leave vine untouched and iconic and left the money flowing in.

Or vine saw the potential in this app and realized that this could be it. They couldn't be suspicious though so they had to make it look as if another company bought tik tok so they first bought musically and kept it under wraps. They then proceeded to buy tiktok.

Don't you wonder why vine 2 is not talked about anymore?

"*The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved one of the most sought after vaccines in recent decades. It’s the world’s first vaccine to prevent dengue fever — a disease so painful that its nickname is  “breakbone fever.”*

*The vaccine, called Dengvaxia, is aimed at helping children in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories where dengue is a problem.*

**But this vaccine has a dark — and deadly — history. One that has led  to criminal charges in the Philippines, and sparked national panic.**

**Estimates are that more than 100,000 Philippine children received a vaccine that health officials say increased their risk of a severe and sometimes deadly condition. In addition, other children who received the  vaccine may have been endangered because, their parents alleged, they  were not in good health.**

The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur spent 20 years — and  about $2 billion — to develop Dengvaxia. The company tested it in several large trials with more than 30,000 kids globally and [published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506223) the results in the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*.

But halfway around the world from the Philippines, in a Washington,  D.C., suburb, one scientist was worried about the new vaccine.

&gt;“When I read the *New England* *Journal* article, I almost fell out of my chair,” says [Dr. Scott Halstead](https://www.emedevents.com/speaker-profile/scott-b-halstead-800221), who has studied dengue for more than 50 years with the U.S. military.

When Halstead looked at the vaccine’s safety data in the clinical trial, he knew right away there was a problem.

For some children, the vaccine didn’t seem to work. In fact, Halstead  says, it appeared to be harmful. When those kids caught dengue after being vaccinated, the vaccine appeared to worsen the disease in some instances. Specifically, for children who had never been exposed to dengue, the vaccine seemed to increase the risk of a deadly complication called plasma leakage syndrome, in which blood vessels start to [leak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334930/) the yellow fluid of the blood.

&gt;**“Then everything gets worse, and maybe it’s impossible to save your life,” Halstead says. “A child can go into shock.”**  
 **“The trouble is that the disease occurs very rapidly, just in a  matter of a few hours,” he adds. “And there’s nothing on the outside of  the body to signify the person is leaking fluid on the inside.”**

He was so worried about the safety concerns that he wrote at least six editorials for scientific journals. He even made a video to warn the Philippine government about the problem.

&gt;**“I just think, ‘No, you can’t give a vaccine to a perfectly normal, healthy person and then put them at an increased risk for the rest of their lives for plasma leakage syndrome,’ ” Halstead  says. “You can’t do that.”**

The vaccine manufacturer disagreed with Halstead’s interpretation of the study’s results. The company [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452651) a rebuttal, asserting that regulatory agencies had approved Dengvaxia  “on the basis of the vaccine’s proven protection and acceptable safety  profile.”

# Despite these concerns, in July 2016, the World Health Organization went ahead and recommended the vaccine for all children ages 9 to 16.

In November 2017, Sanofi [published](https://mediaroom.sanofi.com/en/press-releases/2017/sanofi-updates-information-on-dengue-vaccine/) an announcement on its website saying it had new information about Dengvaxia’s safety.

Halstead’s fears were confirmed. Sanofi had found evidence that the vaccine increases the risk of hospitalization and cytoplasmic leakage syndrome in children who had no prior exposure to dengue, regardless of age.

&gt;**“For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination should not be recommended,” the company  wrote.**

Panic hit the Philippines. In news reports, parents said that the vaccine contributed to the deaths of 10 children.

Protests erupted. The Congress of the Philippines launched investigations into the vaccine’s purchase and the immunization campaign. And Philippine health officials started performing autopsies on children who died after receiving the vaccine.

&gt;**“In total, the deaths of about 600 children who received  Dengvaxia are under investigation by the Public Attorney’s Office, ”** the  *South China Morning Post* [reported ](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3006712/philippines-suspicion-dengue-vaccine-linked)last month.

WHO eventually changed its recommendation. The agency now says the vaccine is safe only for children who have had a prior dengue infection.

By the time Sanofi acknowledged this problem with the vaccine, about  800,000 Philippine children had been vaccinated. The Sanofi study estimated that more than 100,000 of them had never been infected with dengue and should not have received the shot, according to [WHO’s revised recommendation](https://www.who.int/medicines/news/2017/WHO-advises-dengvaxia-used-only-in-people-previously-infected/en/).

Here in the U.S., the approval of the vaccine — to be used in Puerto  Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Guam — comes with an  important restriction: Doctors must have proof of a prior dengue infection to ensure the vaccine will not pose any risks to the child.

That’s a safeguard Philippine families never had.

We have all heard about some theories about aliens and things of that sort being hidden from the public eyes

While watching some video on YouTube about hackers and interesting web activities i came up with a possible Explaination for a phenomenon that is : 
hackers finding documents about aliens and similar things (allegedly).. and publishing it online

My simple theory is :

The goverments came up with an idea  to combat hacking and data theft :

(After having regular security and firewalls and all these stuff)

They needed a way to see if it works or not, right?

So here's what they might have done to find out if there has been a leak or not:

*Create a classified document on a high clearance computer/server 

*Write some titles like : ""operation alfa35"" /"" aliens 24/05/2003 update""

(They could make specific file names for specific bases and servers so they would track down the leak)

And finally

They go online to search for said files/Names

Including deep/dark web searches

If they find something .. that would mean that the security is a joke

If not.. hypothetically it is all ok

I was told today by someone close to me that he is part of a very large and very well planned “tour” *protest* of Hillary Clinton’s neighborhood in NY. Something about she wasn’t charged for some shady things.. idk. Anyhow, there are supposed to be a bunch of biker gangs, conspiracy theorist, extreme Christians, and immense alt-right support. 

Mostly curious if anyone has heard of this or is planning on attending. Apparently infowars and  Fox News are supposed to be there and he’s in touch with Kellyanne Conways lawyer seeking protection for the event.

If you remember there was a Vine 2 coming out at some point or at least people were talking about it being made. So what if the creator(s) of vine realized that vine 2 will never be as successful as the first one so decided to scrap it. People would still talk about it of course (it's iconic duh) but they wanted people to forget about even the idea of vine 2 because they scraped vine 2. What's the best way of doing this? Releasing a similar app (memeability wise) so then there was TikTok.

TikTok was first popularised in Asia which would have the biggest ""test audience"". So vine could have easily created this app to leave vine untouched and iconic and left the money flowing in.

Or vine saw the potential in this app and realized that this could be it. They couldn't be suspicious though so they had to make it look as if another company bought tik tok so they first bought musically and kept it under wraps. They then proceeded to buy tiktok.

Don't you wonder why vine 2 is not talked about anymore?

Anyways, writing this was fun lol",ct

"*The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved one of the most sought after vaccines in recent decades. It’s the world’s first vaccine to prevent dengue fever — a disease so painful that its nickname is  “breakbone fever.”*

*The vaccine, called Dengvaxia, is aimed at helping children in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories where dengue is a problem.*

**But this vaccine has a dark — and deadly — history. One that has led  to criminal charges in the Philippines, and sparked national panic.**

**Estimates are that more than 100,000 Philippine children received a vaccine that health officials say increased their risk of a severe and sometimes deadly condition. In addition, other children who received the  vaccine may have been endangered because, their parents alleged, they  were not in good health.**

The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur spent 20 years — and  about $2 billion — to develop Dengvaxia. The company tested it in several large trials with more than 30,000 kids globally and [published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506223) the results in the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*.

But halfway around the world from the Philippines, in a Washington,  D.C., suburb, one scientist was worried about the new vaccine.

&gt;“When I read the *New England* *Journal* article, I almost fell out of my chair,” says [Dr. Scott Halstead](https://www.emedevents.com/speaker-profile/scott-b-halstead-800221), who has studied dengue for more than 50 years with the U.S. military.

When Halstead looked at the vaccine’s safety data in the clinical trial, he knew right away there was a problem.

For some children, the vaccine didn’t seem to work. In fact, Halstead  says, it appeared to be harmful. When those kids caught dengue after being vaccinated, the vaccine appeared to worsen the disease in some instances. Specifically, for children who had never been exposed to dengue, the vaccine seemed to increase the risk of a deadly complication called plasma leakage syndrome, in which blood vessels start to [leak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334930/) the yellow fluid of the blood.

&gt;**“Then everything gets worse, and maybe it’s impossible to save your life,” Halstead says. “A child can go into shock.”**  
 **“The trouble is that the disease occurs very rapidly, just in a  matter of a few hours,” he adds. “And there’s nothing on the outside of  the body to signify the person is leaking fluid on the inside.”**

He was so worried about the safety concerns that he wrote at least six editorials for scientific journals. He even made a video to warn the Philippine government about the problem.

&gt;**“I just think, ‘No, you can’t give a vaccine to a perfectly normal, healthy person and then put them at an increased risk for the rest of their lives for plasma leakage syndrome,’ ” Halstead  says. “You can’t do that.”**

The vaccine manufacturer disagreed with Halstead’s interpretation of the study’s results. The company [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452651) a rebuttal, asserting that regulatory agencies had approved Dengvaxia  “on the basis of the vaccine’s proven protection and acceptable safety  profile.”

# Despite these concerns, in July 2016, the World Health Organization went ahead and recommended the vaccine for all children ages 9 to 16.

In November 2017, Sanofi [published](https://mediaroom.sanofi.com/en/press-releases/2017/sanofi-updates-information-on-dengue-vaccine/) an announcement on its website saying it had new information about Dengvaxia’s safety.

Halstead’s fears were confirmed. Sanofi had found evidence that the vaccine increases the risk of hospitalization and cytoplasmic leakage syndrome in children who had no prior exposure to dengue, regardless of age.

&gt;**“For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination should not be recommended,” the company  wrote.**

Panic hit the Philippines. In news reports, parents said that the vaccine contributed to the deaths of 10 children.

Protests erupted. The Congress of the Philippines launched investigations into the vaccine’s purchase and the immunization campaign. And Philippine health officials started performing autopsies on children who died after receiving the vaccine.

&gt;**“In total, the deaths of about 600 children who received  Dengvaxia are under investigation by the Public Attorney’s Office, ”** the  *South China Morning Post* [reported ](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3006712/philippines-suspicion-dengue-vaccine-linked)last month.

WHO eventually changed its recommendation. The agency now says the vaccine is safe only for children who have had a prior dengue infection.

By the time Sanofi acknowledged this problem with the vaccine, about  800,000 Philippine children had been vaccinated. The Sanofi study estimated that more than 100,000 of them had never been infected with dengue and should not have received the shot, according to [WHO’s revised recommendation](https://www.who.int/medicines/news/2017/WHO-advises-dengvaxia-used-only-in-people-previously-infected/en/).

Here in the U.S., the approval of the vaccine — to be used in Puerto  Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Guam — comes with an  important restriction: Doctors must have proof of a prior dengue infection to ensure the vaccine will not pose any risks to the child.

That’s a safeguard Philippine families never had.

So it does not seem weird to anyone that he just completely 180 his previous lifestyle and come out guns blazing Americana?  Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with that! It's just, I do not know if it's really him!?

What if ""they"" both DEM's / REP's and The Elite put him in for the sole goal of creating chaos in the US so Socialism seems better then good old nationalistic USA, Because under Trump nationalistic USA means Chaos all the time, fighting with the country's of the world to create a sense of global chaos, fighting with the government nothing is really getting done.

The Economy is Great, But it was great under Clinton to.

People will eventually get tired of the chaos and want it to go away, that's when the compromises will be made by way of voting socialists in, instead of conservatives for the sheer sake of peace!

The Socialists will tailor there message to your misery, then when they get voted in they will transform in to the crooks they are and rob us all of everything!

We have all heard about some theories about aliens and things of that sort being hidden from the public eyes

While watching some video on YouTube about hackers and interesting web activities i came up with a possible Explaination for a phenomenon that is : 
hackers finding documents about aliens and similar things (allegedly).. and publishing it online

My simple theory is :

The goverments came up with an idea  to combat hacking and data theft :

(After having regular security and firewalls and all these stuff)

They needed a way to see if it works or not, right?

So here's what they might have done to find out if there has been a leak or not:

*Create a classified document on a high clearance computer/server 

*Write some titles like : ""operation alfa35"" /"" aliens 24/05/2003 update""

(They could make specific file names for specific bases and servers so they would track down the leak)

And finally

They go online to search for said files/Names

Including deep/dark web searches

If they find something .. that would mean that the security is a joke

If not.. hypothetically it is all ok
